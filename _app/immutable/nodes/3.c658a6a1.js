				minor and began courses. As time passed I felt that the curriculum was not preparing me
				exactly for what I wanted to do. I wanted to learn to build applications and the
				interworkings of the internet. Due to Covid classes went online and I felt my education
				suffered because of it, due to this I decided to pursue full stack development on my own and
				decided to attend a coding bootcamp and online courses instead.</p> <p class="mt-5">In my free time I enjoy a variety of different activites. Besides programming, I am a big
				fitness junkie. I love lifting at the gym and also practicing the Martial Art of Jiu Jitzu
				everyday, competing at several local tournaments trying to improve everyday much like my
				engineering skills. I also enjoy reading, specifically about macro economics, and
				philosophy.</p></div>`;return{c(){e=h("div"),e.innerHTML=n,this.h()},l(t){e=v(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(e)!=="svelte-1w5fd2f"&&(e.innerHTML=n),this.h()},h(){_(e,"class","flex flex-col w-full h-full justify-center")},m(t,a){$(t,e,a)},p:r,d(t){t&&w(e)}}}function b(o){let e,n;return e=new I({props:{title:"About",$$slots:{default:[x]},$$scope:{ctx:o}}}),{c(){m(e.$$.fragment)},l(t){d(e.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,a){f(e,t,a),n=!0},p(t,[a]){const s={};a&1&&(s.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:t}),e.$set(s)},i(t){n||(u(e.$$.fragment,t),n=!0)},o(t){p(e.$$.fragment,t),n=!1},d(t){g(e,t)}}}class M extends l{constructor(e){super(),c(this,e,null,b,i,{})}}export{M as component};
