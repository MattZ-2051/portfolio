				My passion for software development started in college when I picked up a Computer Science
				minor and began courses. As time passed I felt that the curriculum was not preparing me
				exactly for what I wanted to do. I wanted to learn to build applications and the
				interworkings of the internet. Due to Covid classes went online and I felt my education
				suffered because of it, due to this I decided to pursue full stack development on my own and
				decided to attend a coding bootcamp and online courses instead.

				In my free time I enjoy a variety of different activites. Besides programming, I am a big
				fitness junkie. I love lifting at the gym and also practicing the Martial Art of Jiu Jitzu
				everyday, competing at several local tournaments trying to improve everyday much like my
				engineering skills. I also enjoy reading, specifically about macro economics, and
				philosophy.
